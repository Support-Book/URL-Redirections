# PHP URL Redirect
 A Simple PHP URL redirector code.
 
In this code, you would create an associative array `$redirects` where the keys are the shortened URLs and the values are the corresponding full URLs. When a user accesses `http://yourdomain.com/redirect.php?short=abc123`, for example, it will redirect them to `https://www.example.com/page1`.

Remember to replace `'abc123'`, `'def456'`, `'ghi789'`, and the corresponding URLs with your actual shortened URLs and destination URLs.
